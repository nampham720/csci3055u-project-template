## About the language
### History <br />
Swift was developed by **Chris Lattner** in 2010, in cooperation with other programmers at Apple Inc. The idea of the language was taken from Rust, Objective-C, Ruby, Haskell, C#, CLU, Python and other programming languages. 

Swift was first introduced to the community on September 9, 2014 in Apple Worldwide Developers Conference. The version 1.0 was released on the same day, along with Gold Master of Xcode 6.0 for iOS. Swift 1.1 was introduced October 22, 2014. Since then, Swift has received a lot of considerations among the developer community and perceived as one of the most advanced languages to develop nowadays. 

Though being a latest programming language, Swift was voted as the _Most Loved Programming Language_ according to _Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2015_. The success of the language has also drawn the attention from Google that they consider to deploy to language to develop their Android devices. <br /> 

### Some interesting features <br />
Similar to C, Swift uses variables to store and refer to values by an identifying name. Howeverr, Swift manipulates it better. Swift makes extensive use of constants compared to C or Objective-C. Constants are used throughout Swift to make code safer and clearer. <br />

Even thought it is based on C and Objective-C, Swift does not require a semicolon at the end of a command (as long as there is no other commands following) <br/>
```swift
print("test!");
print("test!")
// both print: test!
```
Swift also introduces ``optional types``, which handle the absence of a value. Using this functions 
is similar to using ``nil`` with pointers in Objective-C, but it is applicable for any type in Swift. <br />

Swift is a type-safe language, which means the language is clear in indicating which type of value you are working with. 
If part of the code requires a _String_, type-safety prevents you from passing it an _Int_. Type safety helps you catch and fix errors as early as possible in the developement process.  <br />

## About the syntax
### Variable and types 
Using _let_ and _var_ to declare a constant and a variable repsectively. <br />
```swift
let <name> = <value>
var <name> = <value>
```
_let_ must be assigned with a value while _var_ needs not. Unicode can also be used.
```swift 
let Ï€ = 3.14159
var red, green, blue: Double
```
Automatically the type of the variable will be inferred. However, it can be declared when initializing. The syntax is: <br /> 
``var <name>:<type>``
```swift
var red = 10 // Int 
var red: Double //Double 
```
Syntax for a comment is: ``//``, ``/* ... */`` <br />
Swift a case sensitive language. Therefore, variable ``Man`` and ``man`` are different. <br />
### Whitespaces <br />
Whitespaces are not required, however, they are must be equal if applied.
```swift
int fruit = apples +oranges    //is a wrong statement
int fruit = apples + oranges   //is a Correct statement
```
### Optionals
When a value may be absent, **optionals** is used: ``var <name>: <type>?``
```swift
var surveyAnswer: String?
// surveyAnswer is automatically set to nil
var serverResponseCode: Int? = 404
// serverResponseCode contains an actual Int value of 404
```
### Tuples
Swift also supports **tuples**
```swift
let http404Error = (404, "Not Found")
// http404Error is of type (Int, String), and equals (404, "Not Found")
```
A tuple in swift can be _decompose_ or part of the tuple can be (using an underscore):
```swift
let (statusCode, statusMessage) = http404Error
print("The status code is \(statusCode)")
// Prints "The status code is 404"

let (justTheStatusCode, _) = http404Error
print("The status code is \(justTheStatusCode)")
// Prints "The status code is 404"
```
It can also be accessed by using index:
```swift
print("The status code is \(http404Error.0)")
// Prints "The status code is 404"
```
### Ranges
A range in Swift is defined as: ``(a...b)``, ``(a..<b)`` or ``[..a]``, ``[a..]``<br />
### Functions
Swift requires programmer to be clear about the return type when declaring a function. <br /> 
Syntax: ``func <name>(*parameter*) -> <return type> {*body*}``
```swift
func sayHelloWorld() -> String {
    return "hello, world"
}
print(sayHelloWorld())
// Prints "hello, world"
```
Function is quite dynamic in Swift. A function can take another function as a parameter, have multiple return types (or zero). _Optinals_ can be used as a return type <br />
```swift
// A function with no return value
func greet(person: String) 
    {
        print("Hello, \(person)!")
    }

// A function takes another function as parameter
func printAndCount(string: String) -> Int {
    print(string)
    return string.count
}
func printWithoutCounting(string: String) {
    let _ = printAndCount(string: string)
}

// A function has multiple return types
func minMax(array: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int) {
    var currentMin = array[0]
    var currentMax = array[0]
    for value in array[1..<array.count] {
        if value < currentMin {
            currentMin = value
        } else if value > currentMax {
            currentMax = value
        }
    }
    return (currentMin, currentMax)
}

// A function with optonals return type
func minMax(array: [Int]) -> (min: Int, max: Int)? { *sam as above * } 
// This will return nil when the array is empty
```
